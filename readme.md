This project is made by Mr Syed Muhammad Ahmed for the **Final Year Project** for the degree program of Computer Science at **Sukkur IBA University**. This is done in a group with Mr Agha Asif Durrani.

## About the project
The aim behind automated interviews is to allow for the creation of virtual interviewers that can conduct job candidate assessments. This uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to evaluate candidate responses and provide feedback to hiring authorities. The main aim of this prototype system is to streamline the interview process and reduce the time and resources spent on traditional manual interviews, to help assist the decision-making by the hiring authorities. One of the key benefits of this system is its consistency and fairness. Unlike human interviewers, who may have biases or make inconsistent evaluations, this is programmed to follow a consistent set of rules and provide objective feedback. This helps to eliminate potential biases and ensure that all candidates are evaluated fairly. Additionally, it can also be customized to fit the specific needs and requirements of an organization, allowing for a more tailored and efficient interview process. Another advantage of this application is its scalability; it can be used to interview many candidates in a short period and parallel interviews, making it an ideal system with high volumes of applicants. This is particularly useful for companies that are hiring for multiple positions and for remote hiring, where it may not be possible to conduct in-person interviews.
